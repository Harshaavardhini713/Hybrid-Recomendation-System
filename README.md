Hybrid Recomendation System

We are proposing a Hybrid Recommendation system that uses both collaborative and content based approach.
A dataset from MovieLens was used for this.
The top movies from both the approaches are taken and recommend  to user.
The process is divided into 4 modules:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Collabrative Filtering
3. Content Based 
4. Hybrid system
